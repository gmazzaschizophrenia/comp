For example let us consider /etc/passwd:

- create_users.py would contain the main():
user authentication, groups (?), homedirs

- myPasswdFromDb is the module where I
get info from a file/db and create the file passwd

- authSystem is a link to myPasswdFromDb
and is the name of the module in the main script too.

Likewise I could write
- myNisFromDb
- myLdapFromDb
