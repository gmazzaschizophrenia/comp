User managemnt
==============

This project consists in a bunch of scripts.
The main idea is to have a modular approach:
- a main script
- a module to interface the "database"
  where the user info is stored
- a module to create the config files, i.e.
  either /etc/passwd
  or     NIS
  or     LDAP
